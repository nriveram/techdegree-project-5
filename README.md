# Techdegree Project 5
This project uses public APIs to build a directory for finding friends. A JSON obkect is requested from the API and parsed to build a gallery that contains images, full names, emails, and locations for each person. When a user clicks on a person, a modal with more information pops up. This allows users to learn more about people from the directory. 

I personalized this project, provided by Treehouse, by changing header(s), font, and background color.
